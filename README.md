# 🚀 DevOps Digital Twin Platform

## 📌 Project Overview

The **DevOps Digital Twin Platform** is a cloud-native platform designed to create a "Digital Twin" (a virtual replica) of a Kubernetes-based infrastructure. 

**Why it exists:** Modern cloud architectures are highly complex, making it difficult to predict the outcomes of deployments, scaling events, or system failures. 
**The real-world problem it solves:** Deploying directly to production carries inherent risks of downtime and runaway costs. This platform allows DevOps engineers to simulate deployments, predict infrastructure behavior, identify risks, and estimate cloud costs *before* deploying changes to production.
**Expected outcome:** Safer deployments, optimized infrastructure spending, proactive risk mitigation, and greater confidence in system resilience.

## 🌿 Git Workflow

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Create a feature branch before making any changes. Use descriptive naming:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/topology
   ```
4. Run `npm run build` locally before pushing any changes to ensure the build remains clean.
5. **Never commit directly to the `main` branch.**
6. Always open a Pull Request (PR) for review before merging.
